Bus Tracker Analysis - Ben Cohen-Wang (bencw)

Bus tracking using the KCF object tracker and the provided initial bounding boxes can fairly successfully follow the motion of buses as they move, but often does not correctly capture the dimensions of the bus and only tracks the front of the bus. The primary cause of this problem is that the initial bounding boxes are often only of the area around the front of the bus, since it is not yet completely visible in the camera frame. Another less common issue is that sometimes other moving vehicles enter the bounding box of a bus, causing the KCF tracker to follow their motion instead. These issues could potentially be addressed by improving tracker initialization, which assuming bounding boxes are not provided would involve providing some model to recognize buses. With the given bounding boxes, we could instead only begin tracking once confidence surpasses some threshold.
